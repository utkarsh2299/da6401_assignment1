# DA6401 - Deep Learning Assignment

We will implement the Backpropogation code for a small Neural Network for MNIST/FMNIST dataset.

The goal of this assignment is twofold: (i) implement and use gradient descent (and its variants) with backpropagation for a classification task (ii) get familiar with Wandb which is a cool tool for running and keeping track of a large number of experiments.
